Server responsibilities
- manages data global to the clients (class)
    - Manager
- client management
    - Job
- data management
- knows about replica selection strategies (module)


Client knows about
- How to setup an MD simulation run (module)
- analysis (module)
    - we haven't really decided on how this will work within our framework
    
- At the end of the client loop, send to the server as a post request data and parameters encoding the run that was just performed
    POST /update_replica/<parameters>
        - if run was successful, server writes the parameter set sent by the replica to the database
    GET /next_replica
        - server responds with parameters for the next simulation to be performed by the client

    (More URLs can be defined ...)

Both the server and client can be configured using an external configuration file

- Look at SQLalchemy for database writing and accesses

Admin-Server interaction urls:
Admin is a separate script or module that lets us check on status of jobs, replicas, and the progress of our simulation

GET /admin/list_jobs
GET /admin/list_jobs/<status>
GET /admin/job/<job id>

GET /admin/list_replicas
GET /admin/list_replicas/<status>
GET /admin/replica/<replica id>

POST /admin/start
POST /admin/stop

Replica-Server interaction:

Client request urls:
POST /replica/<replica id>/seq/<sequence id>/new -- requests a new simulation to be started on the client
(server will respond with files (to be defined in a config file or simulation package specific template) for client to carry out the simulation)

Server handling of this request consists of:
1) creating a new entry in the replica table for the requested replica and sequence number
2) updating the status of the last sequence (if it is not the first run) ran by this replica in the database (by updating its finished time stamp and/or the status column)

We discussed whether server or client should manage the files outputted by the client
    - set a configuration option to indicate whether client and server shares a filesystem
    - we will implement the case where client server is sharing a file system for now.
        - if they do not, then client writes all files generated locally, which it then upload to the server as defined by a preconfigured option
        ( should the server know which files will be uploaded by the client?)


To be fleshed out:

Handling of the initial run of the replica set by the server

Error Handling and checking:

Handling replica, job (node) failures.

Replica can fail when (server is up)
    - the node is terminated due to the wall time (a Job failure)
    - the node crashed (or entire cluster is down)
    - the simulation running on the node failed

Job fails when
    - a replica fails
    - or server is down

Distinguish between simulation error failure and wall time expiration (signals could come from PBS? eg PBS_WALLTIME exceeded)

what happens when the server does not respond (connection timed out):
    - this is when the server switching takes place (worry about this, but save it for later!)
