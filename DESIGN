Server responsibilities
- manages data global to the clients (class)
    - Manager
- client management
    - Job
- data management
- knows about replica selection strategies (module)


Client knows about
- How to setup an MD simulation run (module)
- analysis (module)
    - we haven't really decided on how this will work within our framework
    
- At the end of the client loop, send to the server as a post request data and parameters encoding the run that was just performed
    POST /update_replica/<parameters>
        - if run was successful, server writes the parameter set sent by the replica to the database
    GET /next_replica
        - server responds with parameters for the next simulation to be performed by the client

    (More URLs can be defined ...)

Both the server and client can be configured using an external configuration file
